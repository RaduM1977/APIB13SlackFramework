# APIB13SlackFramework

Here you have the Create, Read, Update and Delete message in Slack using RestAssured methods POST,GET,UPDATE and DELETE in Cucumber.
In order to track the message from POST  I used the public static  String TimeStamp variable in order to track the message along in the project.
I created a branch called SlackCRUDMethods so we can review the code before adding it to the main branch. 
I did not push the utils package because I was thinking somebody else will do it so we can see if the code will work that way
(it should be the same or similar with mine)
As a side note when I tried to update the message and I use the POJO class it didn't work so I used the String for serialization of the new message.
Something it is wrong so maybe you can come up with a solution for this!!!
